<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student from the School of Computer and Information Technology at [Shanxi University](https://www.sxu.edu.cn/), co-supervised by Prof. [Ru Li](http://cs.sxu.edu.cn/faculty/professor/1448/index.htm) and Prof. [Hu Zhang](http://cs.sxu.edu.cn/faculty/professor/3367/index.htm).  

My research interests focus on natural language processing, explainable question answering, and logical reasoning. I have published academic papers in international conferences and journals such as ACL, Information Sciences, Information Processing and Management, COLING, Semantic Web, Journal of Chinese Information Processing, and Big Data. I have been granted one Chinese invention patent. 

Additionally, I participated in several explainable question answering competition and received several awards, including the 3rd national prize in [CAIL 2020](http://cail.cipsc.org.cn/task_summit.html?raceID=0&cail_tag=2020), the 2nd national prize in [CAIL 2021](http://cail.cipsc.org.cn/task_summit.html?raceID=0&cail_tag=2021), the 2nd national prize in [CMRC 2022](https://hfl-rc.github.io/cmrc2022/results/), and the 1st place in the [Baidu Reading Comprehension Interpretability Evaluation Leaderboard](https://aistudio.baidu.com/competition/detail/447/0/leaderboard) (both Chinese and English).
